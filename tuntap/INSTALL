Building
========

If you want to build the tun/tap drivers, make sure you have Apple's Developer
Tools installed. Then from the top of the tun/tap source tree issue

	# make

This will build the driver kexts and place them as tap.kext and tun.kext in the
top tun/tap directory. You can install these two kexts directly in
/Library/Extensions. As root, you can simply say

	# make install_kext

Otherwise OS X will refuse to load the extensions. After that, they can be
loaded using kextload:

	# kextload /Library/Extensions/tap.kext/
	kextload: /Library/Extensions/tap.kext/ loaded successfully
	# kextload /Library/Extensions/tun.kext/
	kextload: /Library/Extensions/tun.kext/ loaded successfully

If you want to have the extensions loaded at boot time, use the startup items
provided in the directory startup_items. This can be done using the Makefile (as
root):

	# make install_scripts

I have also included the files used to build the installer packages in the
directory pkg. They can be made by

	# make pkg

This is all I have to say at the moment, feel free to mail me any bug reports,
problems and suggestions you have at <mattias.nissler@gmx.de>.
