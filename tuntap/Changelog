 o Initial Tiger port. We now have KPI-style interfaces. I guess the Tiger
   version is little slower than the Panther version because of all the
   wrapping and hiding in the kernel.
 o The kernel extensions moved to /Library/Extensions. That is the place where
   non-Apple kexts are supposed to live.

April 21, 2005:
 o I added support in tun for AF prepending like some BSDs do. Thanks to Dennis
   kSchneider for mailing the initial patch. You can also set the value of
   AF_INET6 to be used.
 o I finally found that major bug causing crashes (especially on multiprocessor
   machines). It also caused a memory leak (lost mbufs), and might have caused
   performance/througput/data-loss problems. Everyone is recommended to upgrade.

April 6, 2005:
 o I rewrote the common part concerning the tun and tap initialization and
   cleanup. This should make the code more maintainable (less duplication).
 o The devices now reinitialize to the state they were started in when they
   are closed by an application. This concerns IP addresses for example.
 o I changed the package building system to use PackageMaker.app in batch
   mode. The packages also check for version 10.3 now, so nobody should be
   able to install tun/tap on 10.2 using installer packages. Furthermore I
   have sprinkled some warnings telling you not to use tun/tap on SMP machines
   over the installation process ;-)
 o Some minor locking fixes.

November 19, 2004:
 o Jamie Wood reported that the packet queue in the driver could be considered
   empty even if there were packets in it. This was probably caused by a
   synchronization problem that should be fixed now. People encountering
   timeouts etc. should try the new version.
 o I finally implemented support for changing the interface MTU. The driver
   enforces the MTU when writing packets to the character device now. However,
   packets coming from the kernel are not checked.

September 9, 2004:
 o Marcello Teodori told me that the tun driver wasn't working with openvpn.
   The problem was the fcntl call, fixed that. Should work now. Thanks
   Marcello!
 o changed the tun driver not to prepend the address family field before each
   and every packet (which is the behaviour of OpenBSD). As there is currently
   only IPv4 and IPv6 support there is no problem with the standard tun
   approach used on other OSes. This should make the driver much more
   compatible.
 o Did a script and makefile support so that the installer packages can now be 
   built from the command prompt. Unfortunately this might break things
   someday as I am not using the 'official' way to build the packages
 o Cleaned up installer packages a little.

August 24, 2004:
 o initial version put online
 o basic tun/tap support, tap working with qemu
