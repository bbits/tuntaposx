tun/tap driver installer
========================

Read this if you have downloaded the installer packages file. It consists of
several installer packages:

tuntap_installer.mpkg	a metapackage that allows you to install the other
			packets in one simple step. Most users just want to run
			this one.
tap_kext.pkg		contains the ethertap kernel extension
tun_kext.pkg		contains the IP tunnel kernel extension
startup_item.pkg	contains a StartupItem that will load the extension at
			boot time

I have made seperate packages so you can choose to install only parts. This is
also possible from tuntap.mpkg, click the 'Custom installation' button in the
installer dialog.
