tun/tap driver installer
========================

This binary distribution contains a single installer package. Just open it to
install TunTap on your computer. The installer allows to customize which parts
of the package are installed in case you only need either tun or tap.

Unless you really know what you are doing, you should also install the startup
item. If you do not install it, you will have to load the kernel extensions
manually after each reboot using kextload.
