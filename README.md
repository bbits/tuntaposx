TUN/TAP For OSX
===============

This is a tun/tap device driver (kernel extension) for OSX.

This repository is a fork of the [tuntaposx project on source forge](http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/). 

The primary purpose of this fork is to give me a place to fix the kernel panics caused when using tun/tap under OSX Lion. But having spent some time with the code now, I expect there are other things that will need to be fixed up going forward, too...
