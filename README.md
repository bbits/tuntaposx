TUN/TAP For OSX
===============

This is a tun/tap device driver for OSX.

This is a fork of the [tuntaposx project](http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/). 

The primary purpose of this fork was so that I had a place to fix the kernel panics caused by the kext under OSX Lion. But having spent some time with the code now, I expect there are other things that will need to be fixed up going forward, too...
